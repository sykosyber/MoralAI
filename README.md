Macro utility allowing for easy copy-and-paste of 6 epistemological frameworks into any into any LLM dialogue box.

MoralAI: Product Brief v1.0

 Mission Statement: MoralAI is a desktop utility designed to transform general-purpose AI assistants into specialized philosophical thinking partners. It is founded on the principle of user-directed alignment, empowering individuals to explore complex issues through the lens of humanity's most profound worldviews. It makes abstract philosophy operational, accessible, and interactive.

 Core Functionality: At its core, MoralAI is a highly focused 'prompt library' application. It allows a user to select one of six major philosophical frameworks, instantly copying a comprehensive, expertly crafted system prompt to their clipboard. This prompt is then ready to be pasted into any mainstream Large Language Model (e.g., ChatGPT, Gemini, Claude), initiating a conversation guided by the chosen framework's principles, logic, and tone.


The Content: The Six Core Frameworks The initial release will feature six distinct, meticulously crafted frameworks:

  Stoicism: A framework for resilience, virtue, and inner peace by focusing on what you can control.

  Classical Theism: A framework for understanding the world through the harmonious lens of faith and reason.

  Zen Buddhism: A framework for cutting through conceptual thought to experience reality directly.

  Modern Existentialism: A framework for creating one's own meaning in a silent universe through radical freedom and responsibility.

  Ethical Utilitarianism: A framework for making decisions by calculating the greatest amount of good for the greatest number of people.

  Secular Humanism: A framework for living an ethical and meaningful life based on reason, compassion, and human potential.

7. Target Audience & Market Positioning: MoralAI is for the intellectually curious: students, writers, creative professionals, and any individual who wants a deeper, more structured interaction with AI. It is positioned not as a novelty "persona-switcher," but as a serious tool for introspection and critical thinking. Its brand identity directly engages with the concept of AI Alignment, offering a unique, bottom-up approach that empowers the user.

8. Final Vision: MoralAI is a simple tool designed to ask a profound question: What happens when we can consciously choose the "mind" we want to think with? It is a first step toward a more deliberate, diverse, and user-defined future for human-AI interaction.
